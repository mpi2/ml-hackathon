# ml-hackathon
This repository is meant for the participants of the IMPC machine learning hackathon hosted in Munich Jan 2019 to share ideas, track topics, create issues, manage related projects, publish materials, etc.

Welcome
-------
In general, we are trying to keep the structure to a minimum in order to maximally facilitate organic conversations and grouping.

NOTE: We did propose 3 topics originally which you have seen on the agenda, but these are certainly not meant to be exhaustive.  The interest of the attendees will dictate the actual topics to be discussed with the only requirement that there should be at least 3 people interested a topic in order to form a topic group.  The groups will be self-organizing and defined by coalescing of interested people.

Due to the accelerated nature of the meeting (2 half days is really quite short), the general structure of the hackathon will be:
1. Right before lunch, a very (!) short welcome and introduction
1. Right after lunch, we will gather to hear short (1-5 slide proposals: think like 5 minutes long; longer is possible, but please email) from whoever in the group has an idea, either:
    1. Presenting ML approach to IMPC data that has already been performed with the idea of discussing next steps; OR
    1. If you are interested in a specific Machine Learning topic / interested in applying ML to a particular set of IMPC data (maybe you have not yet done anything); OR
    1. Any ML topic really.
1. We will  then break out into working groups around topics of interest to decide what to discuss further / collaboratively learn / try to work on / start working on (for some definition of “work”) on the topic;
1. Reconvene next morning on the 24th in the topic groups and continue “working” on the topics;
1. Mid-morning begin to prepare progress reports / presentations;
1. Finally, reconvene as a large group and hear the presentations / progress / next steps from the working groups. 
This will enable us to establish good working relationships to be continued after the hackathon is over.  Does this format make sense?  The idea is to require lots of participation and interaction.

If you plan to propose a topic, please present your idea with a short overview to the group at the start of the meeting. As mentioned, the recommendation is to prepare one or two slides to kick start the topic.  If you would like to have more, that would be great too, just communicate that so we can keep the timing updated.

**If you know you want to present a topic for discussion, please get in touch with the organisers.**

Ideally, a successful outcome from this hackathon will be:
*	a list of ideas of where and how we can apply machine learning to the IMPC dataset; 
*	an understanding of the current landscape of ML approaches being applied in the IMPC community;
*	good working relationships and which can continue as the nucleus of a ML-focused subgroup of the data analysis WG.
